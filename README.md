**Abstract:**
>*A number of studies have examined the link between rainfall and conflict but results so far have been inconclusive. This study examines the effect of rainfall on economic performance in different sectors and conflict onset. The empirical analysis finds no support for a strong relation between rainfall and conflict as most results are not robust to different model specifications. The results also do not provide conclusive evidence for a link between growth in specific economic sectors and civil conflict onset.*
